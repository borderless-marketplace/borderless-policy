## ACCEPTING THESE TERMS


This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our Terms of Service ("Terms").

The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and Borderless, legally known as Borderless Shopping, LLC.

This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Borderless. We’ll refer to JoinBorderless.com, Borderless, our mobile apps and other services as "Services". By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our websites), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our Services. 

If you use any of our Services, you agree to the following:

* These Terms of Service

* [Privacy Policy](https://www.joinborderless.com/privacy)

* [Prohibited Items Policy](https://www.joinborderless.com/prohibited)

* [Merchant Agreement](https://www.joinborderless.com/merchant-agreement), if you decide to post and sell items on Borderless

## WHAT IS BORDERLESS?


We want to emphasise that Borderless only provides a venue for Shoppers to find, learn about, and enter into transactions with Merchants around the world. It is important to note, however, that Borderless is not a part of that transaction. By shopping on Borderless, you understand that:

1. You are not buying directly from Borderless, but from one of the many Merchants on Borderless;

2. Borderless does not pre-screen Merchants and therefore does not guarantee or endorse any items sold on Borderless or any content posted by Merchants (such as photographs or language used in listings or shop policies); and

3. Each Merchant on Borderless has their own processing times, shipping methods, and policies.

As a member of Borderless, you have the opportunity to flag an item or a shop that violates any of Borderless’ policies. Flagging is confidential.

## PRIVACY


Our [Privacy Policy](https://www.joinborderless.com/privacy) details how your information is used when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it [here](https://www.joinborderless.com/privacy).

Both Borderless and Merchants process members’ personal information (Shopper name, email address, and shipping information) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of Shoppers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing our Services. For example, if a Merchant accidentally discloses a Shopper’s name and email address when fulfilling another Shopper’s order, the Merchant, not Borderless, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.  

If, however, Borderless and Merchants are found to be joint data controllers of Shoppers’ personal information, and if Borderless is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of Shopper personal information, you agree to indemnify Borderless for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of Shopper personal information.

## YOUR ACCOUNT


You’ll need to create an account with Borderless to use some of our Services. 

You must be 18 or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 are not permitted to use Borderless or our Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account.

Provide accurate information about yourself. It’s not OK to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.

If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, or infringes someone’s intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.

You’re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If you’re sharing an account with other people, then the person whose billing information is on the account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If you’re registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Your accounts are not transferable.

As we mentioned above, you’re solely responsible for any activity on your account, so it’s important to keep your account password secure.

These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Borderless.

## YOUR CONTENT


Content that you post using our Services is your content, from here on we’ll refer to it as "Your Content". We don’t make any claim to it. That includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.).

You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.

This allows us to provide our Services and to promote Borderless, your shop, or our Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across any Borderless Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information.

If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to our Services without your permission and you want it removed, please contact us. If Your Content infringes another person’s intellectual property, we will remove it if we receive proper notice. We’ll notify you if that happens.

There are certain types of content we don’t want posted on our Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive or in violation of our [Prohibited Items Policy](https://www.etsy.com/legal/prohibited), or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.

* Race

* Color

* Ethnicity

* National origin

It is your responsibility as a Shopper or Merchant to know your local laws and any other legal regulations on discrimination that might apply to you.

## USE OF OUR SERVICES


We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our Services.

You agree that you will not violate any laws in connection with your use of our Services. This includes any local, state, federal, and international laws that may apply to you. For example, it’s your responsibility to obtain any permits or licenses that your shop requires; you may not sell anything that violates any laws; you must not sell to comply with sanctioned countries and individuals, and don’t engage in fraud, theft, anti-competitive conduct, threatening conduct, or any other unlawful acts or crimes against Borderless, another Borderless user, or a third party.

The name "Borderless" and other Borderless marks, phrases, logos, and designs that we use in connection with our Services, are trademarks, service marks, or trade dress of Borderless in the US and other countries. If you’d like to use our trademarks, please contact us to obtain approval.

Any unsolicited ideas or other materials you submit to Borderless (not including Your Content or items you sell through our Services) are considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.

Borderless may provide you with certain legal information in writing. We may send you information electronically (by email, etc.) instead of mailing you paper copies, and your electronic agreement is the same as your signature on paper.

### Communicating with Merchants

Borderless Shoppers can contact Merchants directly to ask about products, the company, policies, report problems with their orders, return a product, and more.

You may used for the following activities when communicating with member:

1. Sending unsolicited advertising or promotions, requests for donations, or spam;

2. Harassing or abusing another member or violating our Anti-Discrimination clause;

3. Contacting someone after they have explicitly asked you not to; or

4. Interfering with a transaction or the business of another member.

#### Interference

Interference occurs when a member intentionally interferes with another member’s shop in order to drive away their business. Interference is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Examples of interference include:

1. Posting in public areas to demonstrate or discuss a dispute with another member;

2. Purchasing from a Merchant for the sole purpose of leaving a negative review;

3. Maliciously clicking on a competitor's Promoted Listings ads in order to drain that member's advertising budget, also known as "click fraud."

#### Harassment

Any use of Borderless to harass other members is strictly prohibited. Similarly, our Services may not be used to support or glorify hatred or otherwise violate our Anti-Discrimination clause. If you receive or see harassment on Borderless that violates this policy, please contact us right away.

## Purchasing an Item on Borderless


When you buy from a Merchant on Borderless, you’re directly transacting with an independent business, each with its unique listings, policies, and processing times. By making a purchase from a Merchant on Borderless, you agree that you:

1. Have read the item description and shop policies before making a purchase;

2. Have submitted appropriate payment for item(s) purchased; and

3. Have provided accurate shipping information to the Merchant.

### Canceling or Returning an Item

Only Merchants may cancel transactions. Shoppers may request that a Merchant cancel an order via email. You can contact the Merchant about your transactions in the Order History.

Each Merchant has their own return policies, which should be outlined in their Shop Policies. Not all Merchant accept returns. If you reside in the European Union, you may be entitled to a 14-day "cooling off period," or a “right of withdrawal,” during which you may return an item for any reason. 

## REVIEWS SYSTEM


Shoppers can leave a review, including a one to five star rating and a photograph of their purchase, within 90 days after their item’s expected delivery date. The estimated delivery date is the purchase date + processing time + shipping time. Shoppers can edit their review, including the photograph, any number of times during that 90 day period.

On the rare occasion you receive an unfavorable review, you can reach out to the Shopper or, if the review is less than 3 stars, leave a response.

Reviews and your response to reviews may not:

1. Contain private information;

2. Contain obscene, racist, or harassing language or imagery;

3. Violate our Anti-Discrimination clause;

4. Contain prohibited medical drug claims;

5. Contain advertising or spam;

6. Be about things outside the Merchant’s control, such as a shipping carrier, Borderless or a third party; or

7. Undermine the integrity of the Reviews system.

### Extortion

Extortion is not allowed on Borderless. Any attempt to manipulate reviews through threats, intimidation, or bribery is considered extortion and is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Extortion includes when a Merchant offers a Shopper additional goods, services, or compensation in exchange for a positive review. 

### Shilling

Shilling is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Shilling is the fraudulent inflation of a shop’s reputation by use of an alternate account. The intent of shilling is to make a merchant look more desirable by increasing the shop’s number of sales and overall review score. Not only does it violate our core value of transparency, but it is considered to be a deceptive business practice by the US Federal Trade Commission. Reviews must reflect the honest, unbiased opinions, findings, beliefs, or experience of the shopper. 

By uploading a photograph to one of Borderless’ websites, you warrant that:

1. You own the photograph or you have the rights or permission to use the photograph; and

2. You understand that, as stated in Borderless’ Terms, Borderless has license to use any content you provide to Borderless.

Merchants may respond to reviews of three or fewer stars. Merchant’s responses to reviews must also comply with this policy. Merchants may hide photographs that they do not feel accurately represent their brand, or they may report reviews that violate our Terms.

We reserve the right to remove reviews or photographs that violate our policies or Terms.

## TERMINATION


You may terminate your account with Borderless at any time from your account settings. Terminating your account will not affect the availability of some of Your Content that you posted through our Services prior to termination. You’ll still have to pay any outstanding bills.

We may terminate or suspend your account (and any related accounts) and your access to our Services at any time, for any reason, and without advance notice. If we do so, it’s important to understand that you don’t have a contractual or legal right to continue to use our Services, for example, to sell or buy on our website or mobile apps. Borderless may refuse service to anyone, at any time, for any reason.

If you or Borderless terminate your account, you may lose any information associated with your account, including Your Content.

Borderless reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any of our Services at any time, for any reason. We will not be liable to you for the effect that any changes to our Services may have on you, including your income or your ability to generate revenue through our Services.

The Terms will remain in effect even after your access to our Service is terminated, or your use of our Service ends.

## WARRANTIES & LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES


You understand that Borderless does not manufacture, store, or inspect any of the items sold through our Services. We provide the venue; the items in our marketplaces are produced, listed, and sold directly by Merchants, so Borderless cannot and does not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even their legality. Any legal claim related to an item you purchase must be brought directly against the Merchant of the item. You release Borderless from any claims related to items sold through our Services, including for defective items, misrepresentations by Merchants, or items that caused physical injury (like product liability claims).

You may come across materials that you find offensive or inappropriate while using our Services. We make no representations concerning any content posted by users through our Services. Borderless is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted by users that you accessed through our Services. You release us from all liability relating to that content.

You can use our Services to interact with other individuals. However, you understand that we do not screen users of our Services, and you release us from all liability relating to your interactions with other users. Please be careful and exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, especially if you are meeting someone in person.

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You may also need to use a third party’s product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a compatible mobile device to use our mobile apps). When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use. Borderless is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you and the third party.

By participating in a special offer or promotion, you agree that you may not later claim that the rules of that special offer or promotion were ambiguous.

You understand that our Services are provided "as is" and without any kind of warranty (express or implied). We are expressly disclaiming any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties implied by a course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade.

We do not guarantee that: (i) the Services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; (ii) any defects or errors will be corrected; (iii) our Services will be free of viruses or other harmful materials; or (iv) the results of using our Services will meet your expectations. You use our Services solely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Borderless, nor our employees or directors shall be liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with our Services or these Terms. In no event shall Borderless’ aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater of one hundred ($100) US Dollars or the amount you paid Borderless in the past twelve months. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

## Indemnification


If Borderless gets sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means you’ll defend Borderless (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights.

We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.

## DISPUTES


### Disputes with Others

If you find yourself in a dispute with another user of our Services or a third party, we encourage you to contact the other party and try to resolve the dispute amicably. We ask Shoppers to contact a Merchant directly and attempt to resolve any outstanding issues before contacting Borderless. 

Shoppers may contact Borderless for a non-delivery or a not-as-described item. You must respond to any communications with Borderless within seven days or the time frame noted by Borderless in that individual case. Borderless reserves the right to escalate a case early for circumstances such as Merchant inactivity, harassment, refusal of service, manipulation, and undermining the integrity of the dispute resolution procedure.

By contacting Borderless, you understand that under Borderless’ dispute resolution procedures, Borderless may use your personal information for the purpose of resolving disputes with other members. Issues can be filed in the following circumstances:

#### Non-Delivery

A non-delivery occurs when a shopper places an order and submits payment, but does not receive the item. The following are examples of non-delivery cases:

1. An item was never sent.

2. An item was not sent to the address provided on Borderless.

3. There is no proof that the item was shipped to the shopper’s address.

#### Not as Described

An item is not as described if it is materially different from your listing description or your photos. The following are examples of not as described cases:

1. The item received is a different color, model, version, or size than is shown in the photo or described in the listing.

2. The item has a different design or material.

3. The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic.

4. You failed to disclose the fact that an item is damaged or is missing parts.

5. A shopper purchased three items but only received two.

6. The condition of the item is misrepresented.

Not as Described cases can also be filed for late delivery. In order to qualify as late delivery, the Shopper must provide proof that all of these conditions have been met:

1. The item(s) were ordered for a specific date or event.

2. The item(s) are rendered useless after that date.

3. The Merchant did not ship the item(s) according to their processing time or the date agreed upon between them and the Shopper.

If Borderless determines that an item is not as described, Merchants will be required to refund the original shipping and return shipping, in addition to the cost of the item.

#### Ineligible Transactions

Some disputes don’t qualify for Borderless’ dispute resolution procedure. These include:

1. Items that have been purchased in person.

2. Intangible items, services, or [prohibited items](https://www.joinborderless.com/prohibited).

3. Transactions where payment is not made through Borderless.

4. Items that are returned without a return agreement.

5. Items that have been altered, used, worn, or washed after receiving them.

6. Physical or tangible items that are not available for return because they have been destroyed or discarded by the shopper.

7. Items that are received after the agreed-upon delivery date due to shipping delays.

8. Cost of shipping disputes.

When a dispute is ineligible for our dispute resolution, we encourage both parties to work together to come to an amicable solution.

### Disputes with Borderless

If you’re upset with us, let us know, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will govern any legal dispute involving our Services:

The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.

You and Borderless agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find the AAA Rules [here](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/document_repository/Consumer_Arbitration_Rules_Web.pdf)). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis--class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and Borderless are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.

Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules.

We’re based in Dallas, Texas, so any legal action against Borderless related to our Services must be filed and take place in Dallas. For all actions under the AAA Rules, the proceedings will be in Dallas, TX, or otherwise conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties taking into account their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances under the AAA Rules. For any actions not subject to arbitration, you (where your contract is with Borderless Shopping, LLC) and Borderless agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.

If you are a government agent or entity in the United States using our Services in your official capacity, and you are legally unable to agree to the clauses in this section, then those clauses do not apply to you. In that case, the Terms and any action related to the Terms will be governed by the laws of the United States (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Texas.

If we make any changes to this "Disputes" section after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes will not apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against Borderless prior to the date the changes became effective. Borderless will notify you of substantive changes to the “Disputes” section at least 30 days prior to the date the change will become effective. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you may send Borderless a written notification (including email) or close your account within those 30 days. By rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your account, you agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and Borderless in accordance with the provisions of this “Disputes” section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any changes made prior to your rejection. If you reopen your closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the current version of the Terms.

## CHANGES TO THE TERMS

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the changes are material, we’ll let you know by doing one (or more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through our Services or (2) sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you can decide whether you want to continue using our Services. Changes will be effective upon the posting of the changes. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any changes. Your use of our Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

## ENFORCEMENT OF THE TERMS

The Terms, including all of the policies that make up the Terms, supersede any other agreement between you and Borderless regarding our Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.
