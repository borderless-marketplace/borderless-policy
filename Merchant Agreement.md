### Communicating with Shoppers

Borderless Shoppers can contact Merchants directly to ask about products, the company, policies, report problems with their orders, return a product, and more.

You may used for the following activities when communicating with a Shopper:

1. Sending unsolicited advertising or promotions, requests for donations, or spam;

2. Harassing or abusing another member or violating our [Anti-Discrimination](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms) requirements;

3. Contacting someone after they have explicitly asked you not to; or

4. Interfering with a transaction or the business of another member.

#### Interference

Interference occurs when a member intentionally interferes with another Merchant in order to drive away their business. Interference is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Examples of interference include:

1. Posting in public areas to demonstrate or discuss a dispute with another member;

2. Purchasing from a Merchant for the sole purpose of leaving a negative review;

3. Maliciously clicking on a competitor's Promoted Listings ads in order to drain that member's advertising budget, also known as "click fraud."

Any use of Borderless to harass other members is strictly prohibited. Similarly, our Services may not be used to support or glorify hatred or otherwise violate our [Anti-Discrimination](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms) requirements. If you receive or see harassment on Borderless that violates this policy, please [let us know](https://www.joinborderless.com/help) right away.

### Privacy and Protecting Personal Information

This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in which you can use Borderless user information. Such laws may require that you post, and comply with, your own privacy policy, which must be accessible to Borderless users you interact with and compatible with this policy and Borderless’ Terms of Service.

For more information, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.joinborderless.com/privacy).

## YOUR CONTENT


As a member of Borderless, you have the opportunity to create and upload a variety of content, like listings, reviews, text, photos, and videos. In order to keep our community safe and respectful, you agree that you will not upload content that is:

1. Abusive, threatening, defamatory, harassing, or otherwise in violation of our [Anti-Discrimination](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms) requirements;

2. Obscene or vulgar;

3. In violation of someone else’s privacy or intellectual property rights; or

4. False, deceptive, or misleading.

## REVIEWS SYSTEM


Shoppers can leave a review, including a one to five star rating and a photograph of their purchase, within 90 days after their item’s expected delivery date. The estimated delivery date is the purchase date + processing time + shipping time. Shoppers can edit their review, including the photograph, any number of times during that 100 day period.

On the rare occasion you receive an unfavorable review, you can reach out to the Shopper or, if the review is less than 3 stars, leave a response.

Reviews and your response to reviews may not:

1. Contain private information;

2. Contain obscene, racist, or harassing language or imagery;

3. Violate our [Anti-Discrimination Policy](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms);

4. Contain prohibited medical drug claims;

5. Contain advertising or spam;

6. Be about things outside the Merchant’s control, such as a shipping carrier, Borderless or a third party; or

7. Undermine the integrity of the Reviews system.

### Extortion

Extortion is not allowed on Borderless. Any attempt to manipulate reviews through threats, intimidation, or bribery is considered extortion and is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Extortion includes when a Merchant offers a Shopper additional goods, services, or compensation in exchange for a positive review. 

### Shilling

Shilling is strictly prohibited on Borderless. Shilling is the fraudulent inflation of a shop’s reputation by use of an alternate account. The intent of shilling is to make a Merchant look more desirable by increasing the shop’s number of sales and overall review score. Not only does it violate our core value of transparency, but it is considered to be a deceptive business practice by the US Federal Trade Commission. Reviews must reflect the honest, unbiased opinions, findings, beliefs, or experience of the Shopper. 

## CUSTOMER SERVICE


We expect our Merchants to provide a high level of customer service. By selling on Borderless, you agree to:

1. Honor your shipping and processing times. Merchants are obligated to ship an item or otherwise complete a transaction with a Shopper in a prompt manner (within 30 days of purchase), unless there is an exceptional circumstance.

2. Respond to Shoppers in a timely manner.

3. Honor the commitments you make in your shop policies.

4. Resolve disagreements or disputes directly with the Shopper. In the unlikely event that you can’t reach a resolution, Borderless may be able to help with the dispute.

5. If you are unable to complete an order, you must notify the Shopper and cancel the order.

## CANCELLATIONS, RETURNS, AND EXCHANGES


Please be aware that in addition to this policy, each country has its own laws surrounding shipping, cancellations, returns, and exchanges. Please familiarize yourself with the laws of your own country and those of your Shoppers’ countries.

### European Union Right of Withdrawal

Shoppers in the European Union (EU) may be entitled to a 14-day "right of withdrawal" after receiving an item, during which they may return an item for any reason. The details of this right vary by EU member state. The right of withdrawal does not apply to custom items or certain perishable goods. Rights with respect to digital items vary by EU member state.

### Cancellations

If you are unable to complete a transaction, you must notify the Shopper via email and cancel the transaction. If the Shopper already submitted payment, you must issue a full refund. You are encouraged to keep proof of any refunds in the event a dispute arises.

You may cancel a transaction under the following circumstances:

1. The Shopper did not pay.

2. Both you and the Shopper agree to cancel the transaction prior to shipment, and you have issued the Shopper a full refund.

3. You have decided to refuse service to the Shopper and are complying with our [Anti-Discrimination](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms) requirements. If the Shopper has already paid, you must also issue a full refund, including shipping.

4. The Shopper did not receive the item(s) ordered, even though you provided proof of shipping, and you have issued a refund for the item. (Refunding shipping is optional.)

5. Both you and the Shopper agreed that the Shopper could return the item for a refund, you have received the returned item and issued a refund to the Shopper for the item. (Refunding shipping is optional.)

## DISPUTES


We ask Shoppers to contact a Merchant directly and attempt to resolve any outstanding issues before contacting Borderless. For this reason, it is important that you fill out your shop policies and regularly respond to emails from your Shoppers.

Shoppers may contact Borderless for a non-delivery or a not-as-described item. You must respond to any communications with Borderless within seven days or the time frame noted by Borderless in that individual case. Borderless reserves the right to escalate a case early for circumstances such as Merchant inactivity, harassment, refusal of service, manipulation, and undermining the integrity of the dispute resolution procedure.

By contacting Borderless, you understand that under Borderless’ dispute resolution procedures, Borderless may use your personal information for the purpose of resolving disputes with other members. Issues can be filed in the following circumstances:

#### Non-Delivery

A non-delivery occurs when a shopper places an order and submits payment, but does not receive the item. The following are examples of non-delivery cases:

1. An item was never sent.

2. An item was not sent to the address provided on Borderless.

3. There is no proof that the item was shipped to the Shopper’s address.

#### Not as Described

An item is not as described if it is materially different from your listing description or your photos. The following are examples of not as described cases:

1. The item received is a different color, model, version, or size than is shown in the photo or described in the listing.

2. The item has a different design or material.

3. The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic.

4. You failed to disclose the fact that an item is damaged or is missing parts.

5. A Shopper purchased three items but only received two.

6. The condition of the item is misrepresented.

Not as Described cases can also be filed for late delivery. In order to qualify as late delivery, the Shopper must provide proof that all of these conditions have been met:

2. The item(s) are rendered useless after that date.

3. The Merchant did not ship the item(s) according to their processing time or the date agreed upon between them and the Shopper.

If Borderless determines that an item is not as described, you will be required to refund the original shipping and return shipping, in addition to the cost of the item.

#### Ineligible Transactions

Some disputes don’t qualify for Borderless’ dispute resolution procedure. These include:

1. Items that have been purchased in person.

2. Intangible items, services, or [prohibited items](https://www.joinborderless.com/prohibited).

3. Transactions where payment is not made through Borderless.

4. Items that are returned without a return agreement.

5. Items that have been altered, used, worn, or washed after receiving them.

6. Physical or tangible items that are not available for return because they have been destroyed or discarded by the shopper.

7. Items that are received after the agreed-upon delivery date due to shipping delays.

8. Cost of shipping disputes.

When a dispute is ineligible for our dispute resolution, we encourage both parties to work together to come to an amicable solution.

## COMMISSIONS & FEES


Merchants may be charged for using some of Borderless’ services. Please read on to learn about your fees, bills, and taxes, and how to pay them.

### Types of Fees

#### Transaction fee ("Commission")

When you make a sale through Borderless, you will be charged a transaction fee of 8% of the price you display for each listing. If you sell from the US or Canada, the transaction fee will not apply to the shipping cost, sales tax, Goods and Services Tax, or Harmonized Sales Tax, unless you have included those charges in your listing price. If you sell from anywhere other than the US and Canada, the transaction fee will apply to the listing price (which should include any applicable taxes), but will not apply to the shipping cost. Borderless will subtract transaction fees prior to the funds become available for deposit.

#### Payment Processing Fees

Borderless charges a payment processing fee for processing each online transaction. Payment processing fees is 2.9% of the entire transaction amount, including tax and shipping. The payment processing fee is subtracted from the transaction amount prior the funds become available for deposit. 

### **Payment of fees**

You will pay the Fees applicable to your Service and any other applicable fees, including but not limited to those relating to the processing of transactions under your account ("Transaction Fees"), and any fees relating to your purchase of any products or services.

For completed purchases through Borderless, we take a commission of the transaction value to complete the purchase ("Commission"). Together, the Transaction Fees, the Additional Fees, and the Commission are referred to as the “Fees”.

You must keep a valid payment method on file with Borderless to pay for all incurred and recurring Fees. Borderless will charge applicable Fees to the payment method that you authorize ("Authorized Payment Method"), and will continue to charge the Authorized Payment Method (or any replacement method) for applicable Fees until the Services are terminated and any and all outstanding Fees and other amounts owed to Borderless have been paid in full. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees and other charges are in USD.

Fees connected to your application subscriptions may be paid in advance either annually or monthly. If monthly payment is selected, the subscription Fee will be billed in 30 day intervals (each such date will be referred to as a "Billing Date"). Transaction Fees and Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at Borderless’ discretion. You will be charged on each Billing Date for all outstanding Fees that have not previously been collected. Fees will appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Account Owner via the email address provided. In addition, an invoice will appear on the Account page of your Borderless administration console. Users have 14 days to settle any issues relating to the billing of subscription Fees.

We may modify the Fees at any time by posting a notice of such modification through the Service. Any such modification shall go into effect no less than thirty (30) days after it is posted. We’ll notify the User in advance of any change in the recurring amount to be charged for Subscriptions.

All Fees exclude applicable federal, provincial, state, local, or other governmental sales, goods, and services; harmonized or other taxes; and fees or charges now in force or enacted in the future ("Taxes").

You are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from—or as a result of—your subscription to or purchase of Borderless’ products and services. These Taxes are based on the rates applicable to the billing address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to the Fees for such products and services, and will be billed to your Authorized Payment Method; captured via split payment; or charged from your Borderless account. If you are exempt from payment of such Taxes, you must provide us with an original certificate that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such a certificate.

## PAYMENTS


### Payments account

Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Borderless will automatically create a Payments Account on your behalf, using your email address and the URL(s) and business name associated with your account.

You acknowledge that Borderless’ payments service ("Payments Service") will be your payments gateway, and that it is your sole responsibility as the Account Owner to maintain this account during the term of this Agreement. If you do not wish to keep the payment account active, it is your responsibility to deactivate it. 

When creating an account on Borderless, you automatically sign up for a Stripe Account ("Payments Account"), to enable payment transactions on your Borderless Merchant Account.

The Payments Service allows you to accept payment by credit and debit cards, and additional alternative payment methods such as iDeal, Giropay, and others. Borderless may add or remove one or more supported payment methods at any time without prior notice to you.

The termination of this Agreement does not relieve you of your financial obligations as set out in this Agreement and Stripe,PayPal, or our payment processor(s) may elect to continue to hold any funds deemed necessary pending resolution of any other terms or obligations outlined in this Agreement, including but not limited to Chargebacks, Fees, Refunds, or other investigations or proceedings.

### Third-Party Services

Borderless has engaged third-party service providers to perform many of the services related to payment processing, including card processing, currency exchange, identity verification, fraud analysis and regulatory compliance.

Borderless partners with Stripe, PayPal, and other licensed payment processors to facilitate card payments and other payments and the disbursement of funds to Merchants. The provider and processing time for your payment will vary based on the country in which you're located. If there are insufficient funds in your bank account when our provider processes the payment for your purchase, Borderless reserves the right to contact you directly and to seek payment.

By using a third-party service, you may also be subject to an agreement with the third-party. Stripe is a third-party service provided by Stripe, Inc., and is subject to [Stripe’s Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal). PayPal is a third-party service provided by PayPal Holdings, Inc. and is subject to the [PayPal User Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full).

Stripe and PayPal may amend their agreements from time to time. Borderless is not a party to any of Stripe’s or PayPal’s terms or conditions and is not liable to you in respect thereof. If you do not agree to be bound by Stripe’s or PayPal’s terms and conditions, or any changes thereto, you must deactivate your Stripe or PayPal Account, and your Borderless Account.

Borderless may share your personal or transactional information with those third-party service providers when it's necessary to process payments.

If Borderless receives notice that your shop's content or activity violates a third party's service agreement, we may at our sole discretion take action against your account to comply with their policies. Such actions may include canceling a transaction, disabling listings from your shop, suspending your selling privileges, or removing certain payment methods.

#### PayPal

Borderless supports Shopper’s wanting to pay with PayPal. To support this we use integrated PayPal.

Integrated PayPal allows Merchants to receive funds from PayPal purchases directly into their Borderless payment account, without the need to manage a separate PayPal account. This means that if a Shopper pays with PayPal, the funds from the order will be credited to a Merchant’s payment account along with the rest of the orders. The standard Borderless Payment Processing Fee applies to orders that go through integrated PayPal; there is no additional PayPal fee.

Currently, Borderless uses Stripe to payout to Merchants. At no additional cost or fee to the Merchant, when a Shopper elects to purchase an item using PayPal, Borderless will still payout to the Merchant Payout Method using Stripe.

### Transaction fees

In connection with each transfer, Borderless will charge a transaction fee depending on the transaction value. The transaction fee may be amended from time to time.

These transaction fees are applicable to all transactions that occur through the Payment Service.

When a Shopper purchases a Product from your Shop, the funds are transferred to your Payments Account in 7 days, minus the commission and fees described above, which are transferred directly to Borderless.

The Merchant agrees to and allow that Borderless may charge additional applicable Fees to the Payments Account instead of the payment method on file for services like Apps and commission ("Internal Billing").

### Currency conversion

If the Merchant lists and subsequently sells a Product in a currency other than that of the Merchant’s connected payout method, Borderless will settle the associated transaction proceeds in the currency of the Merchant’s payout method.

If a Shopper purchases from a Merchant who lists Products in a currency other than the Shopper’s browsing currency, Borderless may automatically calculate the listing price in the Shopper’s browsing currency. Currency conversion rates are updated every hour.

### **Holds, delays, and charges**

All funds resulting from a completed transaction will be reflected as a balance in a Merchant’s Payment Account. Transfer of payouts to your payout account will be made in accordance with Stripe’s terms and conditions. If Borderless reasonably determines that Borderless may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, criminal behavior, or other legal risks associated with your use of the Service, Borderless may communicate this to Stripe. You hereby agree that such communication from Borderless may lead to your funds being withheld by Stripe for up to 90 days. The same shall apply in cases of chargebacks, disputes, reports from Shoppers to Borderless, or when a Shop Owner’s Account is terminated.

Borderless may impose transaction limits or refuse service to a Merchant or Shopper at any time. Borderless may cancel a transaction if Borderless reasonably determines that the Merchant is involved in criminal or fraudulent behavior; or that the quality, authenticity, or other features of the Products do not conform to the description thereof; or if there are any other legal risks associated with the transaction. In such cases, Borderless will communicate this to Stripe, who may hold or repay the funds to the Shopper. Borderless will communicate its decision to cancel the transaction to the Merchant, who can choose not to deliver the Products until the situation has been resolved.

If there are insufficient funds in the Payments Account to cover the amount of a refund, an Internal Bill, or a chargeback, the Merchant agrees to and allows that Borderless may charge the connected payment method or the connected bank account in order to adjust the balance on the Payments Account.

### **Processing card transactions**

You will not impose any fee or surcharge on a Shopper that seeks to use an eligible payment card.

### **Payouts and transaction history**

Funds available for payout will be deposited to the connected payout method on a weekly basis, unless otherwise agreed upon. There will be a delay on each transaction before funds are available for deposit. Deposits to a Merchant’s bank account will be credited within 3-5 business days, but may in some cases take longer, depending on local bank rules, holidays, etc.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that all credits for funds provided to you are provisional and subject to reversal, including, without limitation, adjustments for inaccuracies and errors (including rejects), and chargebacks, reversals, or claims in accordance with this Agreement and the card network payment rules, whether or not a transaction is charged back by the issuer of the card or the cardholder.

Full refunds must be for the exact amount of the original transaction, including tax, handling fees, and other charges. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to the customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. Refunds processed through the Service must be submitted within 60 days of the original transaction but in all cases, within 3 days of approving the cardholder refund.

### **Chargebacks**

When a chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable to Borderless for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses, or penalties (including those assessed by the Payment Networks or our payment processors). You agree that we may recover these amounts from the payout account associated with your Service Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by us. If we are unable to recover funds related to a chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other legal expenses incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of any chargebacks unpaid by you.

You or Borderless may elect to contest chargebacks connected to your account. Borderless may provide you with assistance, including notifications and software, to help contest your chargebacks. We do not assume any liability for our role or assistance in contesting chargebacks.

You agree to provide us with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any chargeback. You also grant us permission to share records or other information required with the cardholder, the cardholder's financial institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any disputes. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible chargeback.

If the cardholder's issuing bank or the Payment Network do not resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.

We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating or investigating chargeback disputes.

### **Excessive chargebacks**

At any point, Borderless, Stripe, PayPal, the Payment Networks, or our payment processor(s) may determine that you are incurring excessive chargebacks. Excessive chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines. Excessive chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Service, including, without limitation, (i) changes to the terms of your Account, (ii) increases to your applicable Fees, (iii) delays in your payout schedule, or (iv) possible suspension or termination of your Account and the Service. The Networks may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for Merchants with excessive chargebacks.

## TAXES 


You are responsible for collecting and paying any taxes associated with using and making sales through Borderless’ services.

If you sell physical goods on Borderless and reside in the US or Canada, please exclude applicable taxes from your listing prices as we will calculate the tax owed on each sale. 

During your product upload, Borderless may help you categorize your products automatically using artificial intelligence. The categories that we automatically assign via artificial intelligence is not perfect and is subject to errors. Please remember, that you are solely responsible for ensuring that all of your listings are properly categorized and you agree to indemnify Borderless for any losses it incurs in connection with any miscategorization of your listings by you. Borderless will use the category you assigned to the listing(s) to calculate, collect and remit the applicable sales tax. 

If you sell goods on Borderless and reside outside of the US and Canada, you need to include all applicable taxes in your listing prices.

Please remember that Borderless’ fees do not include any withholding taxes that might apply in your home country. You are required to pay Borderless the full amount of our fees and may not deduct any applicable withholding taxes from that amount. Please also note that some countries require Borderless to charge VAT on certain of the fees that you may be charged in accordance with this policy, and that the fees listed in this policy do not include that VAT.
