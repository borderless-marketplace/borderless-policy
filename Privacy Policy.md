#### **Information We Collect & How We Use It**

In order to use our Services, you need to provide us with a valid email address, and for Services that require registration, a name associated with your account that you can choose and that represents your identity on Borderless. You may review, change, or remove that name through your account details and settings. You need to provide this information to enable us to provide you with the Services. Depending on which services you choose to use, additional information, such as a Merchant name, billing and payment information (including billing contact name, address, telephone number, credit card information), a telephone number, and/or a physical postal address, may be necessary in order for us to provide a particular service. You are not required to provide us with this information to sign up, but we will need it to provide certain services.

As a Merchant, we may require information such as your full name, social security number, identification ID or tax ID, date of birth, bank account information, credit card information, and/or other proof of identification in order to verify your identity and provide this service to you and to comply with applicable law. 

Even though Borderless collects payment or billing information, Borderless does not store any payment or billing information. All storing of payment or billing information is stored by our payment processors, Stripe and PayPal.

Depending on your local jurisdiction, you can also choose to allow us to save your credit card information to facilitate the checkout process for future purchases. Borderless may contact Merchants confidentially to request more information about their shops or items listed through the Services, or to ensure compliance with our rules and applicable law.

Borderless doesn’t make money from ads. So we don’t collect data in order to advertise to you. The tracking we do at Borderless is to make our product work as well as possible.

In order to give you the best possible experience using Borderless, we collect information from your interactions with our Services. Some of this information, you actively tell us (such as your email address, which we use to track your account or communicate with you). Other information, we collect based on actions you take while using Borderless, such as what pages you access and your interactions with our product features (like favorites, reviews, and purchases). This information includes records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address, information about your device (such as device or browser type), and referral information.

We use this information to:

* provide, test, improve, promote and personalize Borderless Services

* fight spam and other forms of abuse

* generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Borderless Services

When you create your Borderless account, and authenticate with a third-party service (like Facebook or Google) we may collect, store, and periodically update information associated with that third-party account. We will never publish through your third-party account without your permission.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our [Terms of Use](https://www.joinborderless.com/terms)). If you are under 18, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at admin@joinborderless.com.

#### **Information Disclosure**

Borderless won’t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you.

We may share your account information with third parties in some circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards; (3) with academic or non-profit researchers, with aggregation, anonymization, or pseudonomization; (4) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process; (5) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.

If we are going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others. We will object to requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper.

#### **Data Storage**

Borderless uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon and Google, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Borderless. We maintain two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using Borderless Services, you authorize Borderless to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.

#### **Third-Parties**

Some of the content that you see displayed on Borderless is not hosted by Borderless. These "embeds" are hosted by a third-party and embedded in Borderless. For example: product images and store banners that appear while navigating Borderless’ marketplace. These files may send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly. Borderless does not control what data third parties collect, or what they will do with it. So, third-party embeds on Borderless are not covered by this privacy policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service.

Third-party Merchants requirement some personal information to fulfill your order, for example your Name and Shipping Information. If you do not agree to providing Merchants with some personal information requirement to fulfill orders that you place on Borderless, then you may not use our Services.

#### **Tracking & Cookies**

We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences (such as default language, currency, and country), evaluate email effectiveness, allow our payment processors to function, and personalize content and other information.

Borderless doesn’t track you across the Internet. We track only your interactions within the Borderless (which encompasses JoinBorderless.com).

Some third-party services that we use to provide the Borderless Service, such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/us/privacy/) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full), may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Borderless only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

Borderless complies with the "[Do Not Track](https://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-compliance/)" (“DNT”) standard recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium. For logged-out users browsing with DNT enabled, Borderless’ analytics will not receive data about you, but we will do some first-party tracking in order to customize content and provide data to third-party service providers that enable Borderless Services to work. When you use Borderless while logged-in to your account, we cannot comply with DNT. 

#### **Editing or Deleting Your Personal Information**

If you have a Borderless account, you can access, modify or export your personal information, or delete your account [here](https://www.joinborderless.com/account/settings).

To protect information from accidental or malicious destruction, we may maintain residual copies for a brief time period. But, if you delete your account, your information and content will be unrecoverable after that time. Borderless may preserve and maintain copies of your information when required to do so by law.

#### **Data Security**

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.

#### **Business Transfers**

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer.

#### **Emails from Borderless**

Sometimes we’ll send you emails about your account, service changes or new policies. You can’t opt out of this type of "transactional" email (unless you delete your account). But, you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as promotions, and activity notifications through your account’s “[Settings](https://www.joinborderless.com/account/settings)” page

When you interact with an email sent from Borderless (such as opening an email or clicking on a particular link in an email), we may receive information about that interaction. We won’t email you to ask for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email, please send it to us so we can investigate.

#### **Changes to this Policy**

Borderless may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be [here](https://www.joinborderless.com/privacy) and we will archive former versions of the policy [here](https://github.com/borderless-marketplace/borderless-policy).

#### **Description of Processing Activity**

Borderless collects and stores personal information about its users to customize their shopping experience and enable personalized distribution of content. It shares minimal data with its service providers.

#### **Purposes of Processing**

* Provide, test, promote, and improve the services

* Gather usage statistics of services

* Provide customized shopping experience

* Publish and distribute merchant-generated content

* Fight spam, fraud, and other abuse of services

#### **Legal Bases**

In order to provide the Services, Borderless collects and stores personal data about its users on the legal basis of consent given when you create an account and agree to the Privacy Policy.

Borderless also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the services, as outlined above.

Where Borderless collects and stores personal data about non-users, it does so under performance of contract obligations with users who use the services to publish content on web sites hosted by Borderless. In such cases, users authoring such content containing personal data of third parties are responsible for that content. Borderless will consider related complaints in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation’s rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and access to information.

#### **Public Nature of Personal Data**

Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the Borderless Services in the form of favoriting a product or brand, posting reviews, sharing links on connected social media accounts, or purchasing a product from a Merchant. Where such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user. Additional information on potential consequences of such processing can be found below. If you do not agree to this public usage, do not create an account or use these features of Borderless Services.

#### **Categories of Recipients**

* Hosting, Storage, & Other Infrastructure

* Security

* Analytics

* Communication & Support

* Payment Processors

Search engines will index user profiles, public interactions, and any user-generated content. Users may also share links to your content on social media.

#### **Payment Processors**

Borderless provides Services in conjunction with several payment processors, including: Stripe, Paypal, Google Play, and Apple Pay, through which users may pay for products featured on Borderless or receive payments based upon sales made on Borderless. Those companies acting as payment processors may collect and store personal data related to your billing information and history in order to provide their services, and may collect and store personal data and business data to prevent fraud and other abuse.

Borderless does not store any payment information.

When you delete your Borderless account, Borderless deletes your personal data as outlined in this document. However, to delete your payment or billing information, you will need to do so with your payment provider, as Borderless only has minimal secure access to those records as needed to provide the services.

#### **Embedded Content**

Borderless posts may contain third-party embeds, which may in some cases collect and store personal data. The use of personal data by embedded content providers is not covered by this statement, but by the privacy policies of those sites or services.

#### **Existence of Automated Decision-making**

Borderless collects and stores personal data about its users to customize shopping. This includes automated decision-making to promote content tailored to the preferences and interests indicated by the user, and to their browsing history and network interactions.

Borderless may also filters content for the purposes of fighting and preventing spam, fraud, and other forms of abuse.

#### **Potential Consequences of Processing**

By creating an account on Borderless, users may make certain personal data about themselves public and accessible to others on their profile and through network interactions. This may in some cases constitute special category protected data which is considered manifestly made public by the user.

Due to the public nature of information posted to Borderless, it may be possible for third parties to derive identifying personal data from reviews, whether by reading, inference, supplemental research, or automated extraction and analysis.

Users are free to use their real name and information, or a pseudonym of their choosing, for their account. Users may also choose to use the service without shopping or engaging in network interactions. However, if you do not agree with and accept the risks of such usage, you may not use the services.

#### **Cross-border Transfers**

Borderless is hosted in the United States. By using Borderless Services, you authorize Borderless to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. Where your data is disclosed to our processors, it is subject by contract to at least the same level of data protection as that set out in this statement.

#### **Retention**

Borderless retains personal data associated with your account for the lifetime of your account. If you would like to delete your personal information, you can delete your account at any time. Deleted account will become unrecoverable in our system, immediately upon initiating deletion. It may take several additional days for your personal data to be de-indexed from search engines, depending on those search engines’ practices, over which Borderless may have limited or no control.

To delete your payment, billing, or shipping information, you will need to do so in Your Account.
